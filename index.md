# I work with broadcast and soundscape tech to create more human experiences.

I’m  a designer and producer experimenting with creative and mechanical aspects of online media production. 

As a designer, I seek to understand how we might use sound for, and in the design of physical and virtual spaces. As a producer, I’ve developed extensive experience working with audio/visual equipment to exceed client expectations in challenging production environments.

My practice is acoustically-centred, working with and through sound to explore how we interact with the spaces around us. I currently hold a Master of Design Futures from RMIT University where I investigated acoustic approaches to improving concurrent teaching by using speculative design methods.
